This folder contains an exact copy of the source folder with minified versions
of all of the scripts.

The reason you would want to do this is because kOS has pretty small disk
spaces and tracks program size with a character count. This is dumb for a lot
of reasons, but primarily I hate it because:

(1) It penalizes comments
(2) It penalizes descriptive variable and functions names

These are very necessary things for writing comprehensible programs.

It is possible to compile the .ks files into .ksm, but this doesn't always help
as every compiled file does contain some overhead. IMO this seems to be like *A
LOT* of overhead, but I generally prefer working with small files where the
compilation method really struggles.

*NOTE*: This folder doesn't actually track any files, its contents should be
generated by ksmin.py.
